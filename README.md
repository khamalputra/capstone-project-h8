```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- Supabase project (free tier works great)

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` and populate with your Supabase project credentials:

```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required keys:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` ‚Äì Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚Äì Public anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ‚Äì Service role key (server only; keep secret)

### Install Dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. Run the SQL migration to provision tables, policies, and helper functions:

```
supabase db push --file supabase/sql/schema.sql
```

3. (Optional) Load demo data using the seed script:

```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=... pnpm seed
```

### Running the App

- **Development:** `pnpm dev` (http://localhost:3000)
- **Production build:** `pnpm build` then `pnpm start`

### Testing

```
pnpm test
```

### Linting

```
pnpm lint
```

### Deployment

- Deploy to Vercel.
- Configure the environment variables in Vercel project settings.
- Ensure Supabase redirect URLs include the production domain for auth callbacks.

## Supabase Policies Overview

- Users can view and update only their profile; role changes restricted to admins via trigger.
- Services and availability are managed solely by the owning provider; marketplace read access is public.
- Bookings obey RLS: users see their own, providers see theirs, and updates check permitted status transitions.
- Reviews can only be inserted by the booking owner after completion; a Postgres function updates aggregate rating.

## Docs & Screenshots

Screens to capture for presentations (use Vercel preview or `pnpm dev`):

- `docs/screens.md` *(create screenshots for)*
  - Landing page hero + featured services
  - Services list with filters applied
  - Service detail booking drawer
  - User bookings dashboard
  - Provider dashboard incoming requests
  - Admin approval queue

## AI Support Explanation

IBM Granite was used during development to accelerate code generation, refactoring, and documentation drafts. The generated code was reviewed, refined, and validated before inclusion; the production build contains only audited, deterministic code.
